Create a Python dashboard with MySQL integration. Use mysql-connector to connect to the database and Tkinter or Flask for the interface. The dashboard allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and displays data dynamically. Itâ€™s a practical project to enhance Python and database skills.
